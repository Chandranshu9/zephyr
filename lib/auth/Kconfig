		Used to break up messages into smaller chunks over the lower transport.
		For example, a 60 byte message send over a Bluetooth link with a 23 byte
		MTU would be broken into three fragments of sizes 23, 23, and 14.
		If not set, then the messages are sent and received as a byte stream with
		no message boundary.

	    Each authentication instance uses a thread to authenticate with
	    a peer over the lower transport.  It is possible to have multiple
	    authentication instances where one instance authenticates a peer
	    over Bluetooth and another authenticates over a serial link.  Another example
	    would be a Bluetooth Central needing to authenticate multiple
	    connected Peripherals.
